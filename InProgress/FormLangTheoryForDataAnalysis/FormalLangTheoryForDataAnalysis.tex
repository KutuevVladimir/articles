\section{Introduction}

Bridging the gap between fundamental disciplines and application is one of the important problems of education in software engineering. At the same time, real-world problems requires huge amount of preparatory work before the !!!

Data analysis involves broad range of !!! . Graph analysis. Application of fundamental ones. Motivation for students which focused on applied areas to study fundamental disciplines 

Integration: Formal languages + HPC + linear algebra + graphs To show interconnection between different areas. How concepts and ideas from one area can be applied in another one. 

For engineers, so it is important to equip theory with practical tasks to !!!motivate!!!. Historically, programming languages and natural language processing form an area of formal languages theory application 

Our experience. Third-year bachelor students. Software engineering.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Motivation
  \item Course structure: technical environment, Exercises and how they are related to !!!
  \item Discussion of !!!
\end{itemize}  

\section{Motivation}

We are aimed to !!!! !!! !!! 

Why formal language constrained path querying. Formal languages is not only parsing. 

Immediate and direct usage of theory to solve practical tasks: Closure properties. Languages intersection.  Results representation --- languages representation. Complexity analysis.

Parsing algorithms. New old problems: incremental parsing, parallel parsing.

HPC, matrices, easy to abstract. As a result, easy to apply for real-world data. Which also helps to solve a motivation problem (small synthetic tasks looks disconnected with real-world).

Selected algorithms can be expressed in terms of boolean matrices and vectors: easy to start. No need to create custom semirings. At the same time, native description requires custom semirings. Conversion techniques.

Relations with other areas such as graph theory, dynamic graph problems, algebra.

Open problems (truly subcubic CFPQ).

\section{Course}

 Actually, our course is a practical part of formal language theory course.

Prerequirements:  linear algebra, Python programming.

Formal language theory, 

Basic graph theory can be introduced on the fly,

Environment. Automatization. Python programming language, PyFormLang\footnote{!!!}~\cite{10.1145/3408877.3432464} for basis forma languages concepts: regular expressions, finite automata, context-free grammars, recursive automata, and operations over them (automata minimization, regular expression to finite automata conversion) , CFPQ-Data\footnote{!!!} as a collection of graphs and queries, sciPy\footnote{!!!} for sparse linear algebra, pyGrpahBlas\footnote{!!!} for advanced sparse linear algebra, pyCubool\footnote{!!!}~\cite{!!!}, Google colab.
Testing (unit tests), code style guide checkers, automation using GitHUb actions.

Structure
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction to formal languages, problem statement (FLPQ), different semantics. Problems (infinite number of paths). String to graph generalization. 
  \item Introduction to graphs and linear algebra. Matrices, edge-labelled graphs. 
  \item Regular languages, queries. Closure properties, languages representation.
  \item Context-Free languages, queries. Closure properties. Language representation.
\end{enumerate}

Exercises. Focused on reachability problem. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item RPQ tensors. FA intersection. (commutativity of Kronecker product)
  \item RPQ multiple-source BFS-based. Another algorithm for automata intersection. Multiple-source BFS.  
  \item RPQ evaluation and performance analysis. Different matrices formats etc. All-pairs vs multiple sources. Advanced: GPU or GraphBLAS
  \item CFPQ Hellings
  \item CFPQ matrices (associativity and commutativity of operations)
  \item CFPQ tensors (unification of RPQ and CFPQ), RSF
  \item CFPQ evaluation and performance analysis. Different algorithms comparison. Advanced: GPU or GraphBLAS 
  \item Query language design. Introduction of GQL and other real-world languages. 
  \item Query language implementation
\end{enumerate}

Can be splitted in subtasks or equipped with additional intros (for example, simple tasks aimed to introduce new library). 

Outcomes 
FLPQ
HPC

\section{Discussion}

Motivation to study formal languages, refresh algebra, HPC....
Why matrices: pretty simple ideas and algorithms, rather than LR, hides implementation complexity, clear abstraction (it is easy to realize that one library of linear algebra operations can be replaced with another one). More over, students can do it yourself.

Also we want to highlight some drawbacks and weakness of our course.
First is that non-linear-algebra-based algorithm for FLPQ (and parsing, respectively) are missed. Based on GLR, GLL. These algorithms are Powerful (can natively solve all-paths queries), but require special techniques that cannot be natively inferred from linear-algebra-based algorithms. Especially high-performance solution. Looks like advanced block. 

Hides basics of some concepts. But learn to use existing libraries that useful skill and allows students to touch real-world problems and tasks.

Directions 
Multiple sources versions of algorithms for CFL-r. But it should be simplified first. A bit more concepts required.
Non matrix based algorithms.
Beyond context-free (MCFG). Desidability problems, so on.
