abstract = {Formal languages are widely studied, taught and used in computer science. However, only a small part of this domain is brought to a broader audience, and students often have no practical experience in their curriculum. In this tool paper, we introduce Pyformlang, a practical and pedagogical Python library for formal languages. Our library implements the most common algorithms of the domain, accessible by an easy-to-use interface. The code is written exclusively in Python3, with a clear structure, so as to allow students to play and learn with it.},
