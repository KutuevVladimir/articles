\section{Introduction}

Scalable high-performance graph analysis is an actual challenge.
There is a big number of ways to attack this challenge~\cite{Coimbra2021} and the first promising idea is to utilize general-purpose graphic processing units (GPGPU).
Such existing solutions, as CuSha~\cite{10.1145/2600212.2600227} and Gunrock~\cite{7967137} show that utilization of GPUs can improve the performance of graph analysis, moreover it is shown that solutions may be scaled to multi-GPU systems.
But low flexibility and high complexity of API are problems of these solutions.

The second promising thing which provides a user-friendly API for high-performance graph analysis algorithms creation is a GraphBLAS API~\cite{7761646} which provides linear algebra based building blocks to create graph analysis algorithms.
The idea of GraphBLAS is based on a well-known fact that linear algebra operations can be efficiently implemented on parallel hardware.
Along with that, a graph can be natively represented using matrices: adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, etc.
While reference CPU-based implementation of GraphBLAS, SuiteSparse~\cite{10.1145/3322125}, demonstrates good performance in real-world tasks, GPU-based implementation is challenging.

One of the challenges in this way is that real data are often sparse, thus underlying matrices and vectors are also sparse, and, as a result, classical dense data structures and respective algorithms are inefficient. 
So, it is necessary to use advanced data structures and procedures to implement sparse linear algebra, but the efficient implementation of them on GPU is hard due to the irregularity of workload and data access patterns.
Though such well-known libraries as cuSPARSE show that sparse linear algebra operations can be efficiently implemented for GPGPU, it is not so trivial to implement GraphBLAS on GPGPU. 
First of all, it requires \textit{generic} sparse linear algebra, thus it is impossible just to reuse existing libraries which are almost all specified for operations over floats.
The second problem is specific optimizations, such as masking fusion, which can not be natively implemented on top of existing kernels.
Nevertheless, there is a number of implementations of GraphBLAS on GPGPU, such as GraphBLAST~\cite{yang2019graphblast}, GBTL~\cite{7529957}, which show that GPGPUs utilization can improve the performance of GraphBLAS-based graph analysis solutions.
But these solutions are not portable because they are based on Nvidia Cuda stack.

GraphBLAS design issues!!! 

To provide portable GPU implementation of GraphBLAS API we developed a \textit{SPLA} library\footnote{Source code available at: \url{https://github.com/SparseLinearAlgebra/spla}}.
This library utilizes OpenCL for GPGPU computing to be portable across devices of different vendors.
!!!!
To sum up, the contribution of this work is the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design of portable GPU GraphBLAS-like API proposed. Solves some desingn problems !!! Additionally, the proposed design is aimed to simplify library tuning and wrappers for different high-level platforms and languages creation.
    \item Implemented. !!!!
    \item Evaluation on such algorithms as breadth-first search (BFS), single source shortest path (SSSP), page rank (PG), and triangles counting (TC), and real-world graphs shows portability across different vendors and promising performance: !!!. Surprisingly, for some problems, the proposed solution on embedded Intel graphic card shows better performance than SuiteSparse on the respective CPU. At the same time, the evaluation shows that further optimization is required.
