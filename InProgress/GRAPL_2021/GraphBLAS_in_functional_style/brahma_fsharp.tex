Runtime code generation: generics, functions.... 
In comparison to templates (GraphBLAST): compiled library, not header-only library. 
Easy compilation, no additional compile-time dependencies, compilers and so on. 
Cold start problem. 
More flexible, more information can be captured by translator.
Kernels can be cashed. 

Basic OpenCL C: basic control flow, local memory, atomic operations, barriers, memory flags,

Supported F\#-related features: DU, pattern matching, structures, ....

Message-based asynchronious API F\#-native \textbf{Mailbox processor}\footnote{Mailbox processor is a standard primitive to organize message-based asynchronious computations. Official documentation: \url{https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-control-fsharpmailboxprocessor-1.html}. Access date: 08.01.2023.} primitive.
